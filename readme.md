# pySpaceship
pySpacheship is a python game I created using the pyGame framework. During the course of creating this project I learnt how to effectively implement event loops, handle user input, draw items on the screen and use pygame modules to play sound effects and music.

Teck stack used includes: Python & pyGame Framework

## How to Install and Run the Project
Use ppip install pygame to install pygame framework. After moving into project directory run python py_tut_with_images.py to start the game.
